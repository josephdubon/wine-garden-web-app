            You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or

            “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the Site in a manner that sends more request messages to the
            WineGarden servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional
            on-line web browser (except that WineGarden grants the operators of public search engines revocable
            permission to use spiders to copy publically available materials from WineGarden.io for the sole purpose of

            not caches or archives of such materials); (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited
            email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any
            transmissions to or from the servers running the Site; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at
            our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading

            personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Site; (viii) using the Site for
            any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your
            affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x)
            interfering with the proper working of the Site; (xi) accessing any content on the Site through any
            technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Site; or (xii) bypassing the measures
            we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Site, including without limitation features that prevent or
            restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Site or the content therein.

            We may, without prior notice, change the Site; stop providing the Site or features of the Site, to you
            or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Site. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or
            suspend your access to the Site without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole
            determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason
            or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.

            Assumption of Risk; Release of Claims.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            You acknowledge that the Site (including without limitation the Protocol and the Smart Contracts) and
            your
            use of the Site contain certain risks, including without limitation the following risks: That any Smart
            Contracts you interact with are entirely your own responsibility / liability, and WineGarden is not a
            party
            to the Smart Contracts; At any time, your access to your Assets may be suspended or terminated or there
            may
            be a delay in your access or use of your Assets which may result in the Assets diminishing in value or
            you
            being unable to complete a Smart Contract and the Protocol may be suspended or terminated for any or no
            reason, which may limit your access to your Assets.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Accordingly, you expressly agree that:
            <br/>
            (A) you assume all risk in connection with your access and use of
            the
            Site, the Protocol and the Smart Contracts; and (B) that you expressly waive and release WineGarden from
            any
            and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way related to your use
            of
            the Site, the Protocol or the Smart Contracts. If you are a California resident, you waive California
            Civil
            Code §1542, which says: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR
            SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER
            MUST
            HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”

            you

            content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Site will meet your requirements; that the Site will
            be
            available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will
            be
            corrected; or that the Site is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or

            <br/>

            WineGarden does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or site

            Limit of Liability.

            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall WineGarden, its affiliates, agents,
            directors, employees, suppliers or licensors be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special,
            consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill,
            use,

            errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature
            whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our site; (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of
            our
            secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein; (iv) any interruption or
            cessation of
            transmission to or from the Site; (v) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be
            transmitted
            to or through our site by any third party; (vi) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss
            or
            damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made
            available through the Site; and/or (vii) User Content or the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct
            of
            any third party. In no event shall WineGarden, its affiliates, agents, directors, employees, suppliers,
            or
            licensors be liable to you for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or
            costs
            in an amount exceeding the amount you paid to WineGarden hereunder or $100.00, whichever is greater.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort,
            negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if WineGarden has been advised of the possibility
            of such damage. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in
            the applicable jurisdiction.
            <br/>

            Limitations as Allowed by Law.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            Federal law, some states, provinces and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion and limitations
            of certain implied warranties, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
            the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This agreement gives you specific legal rights,
            and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers, exclusions, and
            limitations of liability under this agreement will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            Read this section carefully because it requires the parties to arbitrate their disputes and
            limits the manner in which you can seek relief from WineGarden. For any dispute with WineGarden, you
            agree to first contact us at legal@WineGarden.io and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In
            the unlikely event that WineGarden has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60)
            days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any claims for injunctive or
            other equitable relief as provided below) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this
            Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by JAMS,
            under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. JAMS
            may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York, unless you and
            WineGarden agree otherwise. If you are using the Site for commercial purposes, each party will be
            responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS
            rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’
            fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Site for
            non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you
            apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may
            include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and
            other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first
            engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute
            resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
            competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing WineGarden from seeking
            injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened
            infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other
            proprietary
            rights.

            Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            With respect to all persons and entities, regardless of whether they have obtained or used the site for
            personal, commercial or other purposes, all Claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity,
            and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney
            general action or other representative proceeding. This waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless
            we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by
            entering into this agreement, you and WineGarden are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
            participate in a class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other
            representative
            proceeding of any kind.
